# SealSync

Android app to sync audio between youtube playlists and your local folder with one click.

## Principles
- Once playlists + configs are set up, syncing audio should be completely frictionless
- Youtube playlists as the source of truth
  - Add video(s) to playlist / add playlist(s) with video(s) → downloads audio file(s) to folder
  - Remove video(s) from playlist / remove playlist(s) with video(s) → deletes audio file(s) from folder
- Simple and intuitive UI to serve this very specific purpose
